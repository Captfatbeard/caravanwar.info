## Abilities:

**Deflect**

Grants the vehicle a chance of 30% to deflectany attack. The chance decreases to 15% if the Barrier's level is lower than the attacker

## Description:

The shields are essential for a solid defense system, and this unit is worth every penny!

The barrier is not only a shield, but it also deals damage with a fair the attack speed. If you did not dare to place the cargo carts in the outer ring of the wave, simply with this Barrier, the tactics of each wave are enhanced. You can comfortably choose a full wave of vehicles with epic add-ons without using too many units to cover up. The ideal strategy is to place the Barrier on to the train and you can still add a special add-on that deals damage or other effects without weakening the convoy.

You should note that the ability to dodge is 30%, and it will be reduced to 15% if your HQ level lower than the enemy. Moreover, our epic Barrier cannot defend against the Windlane Tower and the true strike ability (never missed attacks) of Blaze Tower. Bare this in mind to have a suitable tactic for the convoy!
