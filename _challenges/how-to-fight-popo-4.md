Bring your small guards and some kind of airborne guardian out for a fantastic adventure.

This is a perfect popo if you wanna do double popo and you haven't got the guardians level for it.

The popo will be in shapes of 2, 3 or 4 popos (small ones).

If your damage isn't enough he will start to regen hp %.

Popo #4 has 2 stages doing the fight.

**Stage 1:** Spawn small popos around the map.

**Stage 2:** Becomes a big popo again, after a while, he spawns Infernals 2 pieces of them and 3 times.

# How to kill Popo #4

Start with your guards so they can tank the popo and meanwhile put some air guardians out there on the field.

If possible try to get one small popo at the start.

When the first popo is dead they will carry on to the next one.

When it dies the big popo will spawn and he will spawn 2 Infernals.

If you use air guardians those Infernals won't reach them and you can't nuke the popo for free.

He will do it 3 times and when you killed all of them he's there to be finished of getting killed with all you got until the end.
