# Challenge 2

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Start by building two Marksman Towers. We need these to destroy the Steam Van so our Rogue can get to work.

You can deploy the Rogue as soon as the Steam Van only needs one hit. You want to deploy him on the left side so he will focus the Speeder right after destroying the Steam Van.

Let the Rogue do his work and build Mage Towers at the last turn as you get tower points.

Wait for the Griffen Rider to get in front of the Air ship and upgrade the Mage Tower into a Blaze and your all set.
