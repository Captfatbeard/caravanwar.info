# Challenge 1

**Goal:** 1-star victory

Start by placing a Hydra and a Bombard at the turn, then as soon as you have enough tower points upgrade the bombard to a Cannon for the win.

In this challenge, we need to separate the Helicopter from the Guardians and this can be done with a Lighting Tower.

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

Another timing challenge is here. this time we need to time the upgrade of a Ranger Tower to a marksman to destroy the Chariot.

I have seen two versions of this. One is having the Ranger Tower in the second turn, this makes it easy to time your upgrade. But I liked having the Ranger tower in the first turn. Its harder to time the upgrade but you donâ€™t rely on crit to win.

# Challenge 4

**Goal:** 2-star victory

Start by placing down 3 Bombards like below and use your 2 mines to get as much dmg in on as many units as possible before the turn.

Then the convoy finishes the first turn and your 3rd Bombard starts hitting, deploy your Rouge behind. This will make the whole convoy stay in all 3 Bombards range and get more dmg in.

Then the Convoy enters the second down upgrade the last Bombard into a Rocket Tower and add Ranger Towers as needed along the way.
