Let’s take a look at this weeks Boss, Popo#3, and see how to beat him. For me, this has been the easiest one so far.

# Sum up!

Just to sum up how this Boss Fight Challenge is working. *(if you read my other guides on Popo, this is the same shit over again)*

Bosses like Popo will be the same lvl as your HQ, so if your HQ is lvl 5, Popo is lvl 5. If your lvl 15 like me, Popo will be lvl 15 as well.

Popo targets both air and ground so no matter what troop you're using, Popo will be able to fight back.

You have to fight Bosses with your own Guardians, and they have the lvl you upgraded them to. So if your HQ is a higher lvl than your Guardians are, you will have trouble doing these challenges.

# Popo #2’s stages

Just like last week, Popo has 3 stages doing the fight.

**Stage 1:** At the beginning of the fight, Popo will spawn 2 Dark Knights every 15 seconds.

**Stage 2:** At the 70% mark, Popo will split into 2.

**Stage 3:** At the 30% mark, both Popos starts dealing AOE dmg round themselves every 2 seconds.

# How to kill Popo #2

Start by placing some melee troops first *(once again I used Champions)* and add Ranged damage dealers in the back *(Marshals is OP once more)*.

This time Popo’s stage switches ain’t killing of troops or anything. So just keep up deploying your melees and from time to time add a ranged damage dealer. It’s that simple

I really hope this guide helped you get all the rewards! Please let me know in the comments which troops you end up using and what your record time is.
