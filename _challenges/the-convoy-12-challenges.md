# Challenge 2

This took me many tries, and I even solved it with another formation but is was not consistent. But this formation I only get 25 cargo stolen every time!

# Challenge 3

Not sure what this was? Troll challenge Hiker Games?

Why did we have the chance to use a Helicopter in a challenge like this? Not a single Air target tower.

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 350 cargo
