Sorry to say this, but all convoy challenges this week took me some goes, seems like you need some luck. But lets take a look on the setups that I got my rewards with.

Goals was displayed different before start on the setup screen, and then after you start. Im going to list the goals from after start.

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 200 cargo

If your Airship or Helicopter gets pinned, start over!
