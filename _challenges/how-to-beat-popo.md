Yesterday we saw the very first Boss in the new challenge mode Boss Fight! His, her, I'm not sure... Its name is Popo and is a slime!

A lot of people have asked me to do a guide on Popo so I will do my best to help you out getting the 100% win and collect your rewards.

Bosses like Popo will be the same lvl as your HQ, so if your HQ is lvl 5, Popo is lvl 5. If your lvl 15 like me, Popo will be lvl 15 as well.

Popo targets both air and ground so no matter what troop you're using Popo will be able to fight back.

You have to fight Bosses with your own Guardians, and they have the lvl you upgraded them to. So if your HQ is a higher lvl than your Guardians are, you will have trouble doing these challenges.

# Popo's 3 stages

First Popo is just this big cute slime jumping up and down. But when his HP drops below 80% he will explode into smaller versions of Popo's and kill all deployed troops.

The smaller Popo's all attack at the same time and this increases the dmg output on your troops a lot.

The last stage is when you get the total HP down below 40%. Now the smaller popos will reform into big Popo and it will begin to spawn Witches every 10 seconds.

# How to kill Popo

Okay so how do we kill Popo you may ask. This is a tough one. As I mentioned Popo will have the same lvl as your HQ, and on top of that, you can only use your own Guardians. This means that we all probably will beat Popo in different ways.

But what I can do is give you some pointers on what worked out for me, and what I have seen from others getting that sweet 100% win.

First off don't spam the first stage of Popo, try to find out what the least amount of troop points you can use to get Popo to 80%. For me, this was 6 Champions.

Popo will explode and kill all of your troops. We're not trying to get you the fastest run the first time so, just wait a couple of seconds to get some more troop points.

Now place down a Tank **(I used Golem)** and place down a couple of smaller melee troops around the Popo's, and some support with some more expensive ranged troops like Marshals.

Now you "just" need to keep deploying "cheap" melee troops to keep the popos away from your ranged troops.

The same for the last stage with witches, try to keep them from killing your ranged troops. SPAM THEM MELEE'S.

Let me know if this helped you out in any way, and if you got your 100% in the comments! Do you want me to do more Guides like this one when the next boss shows up?

If you want to take a look at my first 100%, you can [watch it over on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWttJ7rdaOA).
