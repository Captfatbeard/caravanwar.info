Hey guys. Iâ€™m sorry for the delay on this guide, but I have been on a family vacation, and I just got back. Next week I will be back on track again.

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

Deploy your bandits at the very start of the path together with a Hospital. Now just keep adding Hospitals as your Vikings are running along the path.

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

Build a Lighting Tower and a Crossbow like shown in the image below. The Lighting Tower is to try to separate the Airship a little, and the Crossbow is meant to be upgraded into a Windlance at the right moment to pin the Airship.

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Build a Missile Tower in the first turn and as soon as it hits the first Helicopter you should use your Freeze spell to keep the Helicopter in place. *(this makes it possible for the Missile Tower to hit multiple Helicopters)*

After the Rouge destroys two Wagons, you will have enough energy to upgrade the Bombard into a Cannon.
