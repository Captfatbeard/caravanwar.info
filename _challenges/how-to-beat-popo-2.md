Let’s take a look on this weeks Boss, Popo #2 and see how to beat him.

# Sum up!

Just to sum up how this Boss Fight Challenge is working. *(if you read my guide on Popo #1, this is the same shit over again)*

Bosses like Popo will be the same lvl as your HQ, so if your HQ is lvl 5, Popo is lvl 5. If your lvl 15 like me, Popo will be lvl 15 as well.

Popo targets both air and ground so no matter what troop you're using Popo will be able to fight back.

You have to fight Bosses with your own Guardians, and they have the lvl you upgraded them to. So if your HQ is a higher lvl than your Guardians are, you will have trouble doing these challenges.

# Popo #2’s stages

Just like last week, Popo has 3 stages doing the fight.

**Stage 1:** At the beginning of the fight Popo will deal AOE dmg around himself every 5 second

**Stage 2:** At the 70% mark, Popo will start deploying Djinn’s every 15 seconds. At the same time, Popo returns you maximum 300 mana.

**Stage 3:** At the 30% mark, Popo will use a laser beam that kills the highest HP troop every 2 seconds.

# How to kill Popo #2

At the start in stage one use low-cost melee troops *(one by one)* to lure Popo around and away from your ranged damage dealers. I used Champion as me lure troop and Marshal as my Range damage dealer.

As Popo enters stage 2 just spam your troops as much as you can to you win!

I really hope this guide helped you get all the rewards! Please let me know in the comments which troops you end up using and what your record time is.
