Convoy no. 6 Challanges is here, so lets take a look on how to solve them.

 **ATTENTION! If you wanna solve the Challanges yourself you should not read any further!**

 # Challange 1

 This one was pretty stray forward. Spam your troops and hide cargo in the back.

 # Challange 2

 This one was a tough one, and by the replays I have looked at, it seems to depend a little on luck. But if you have a version that always works please try to send me a ingame PM.

 This is the version I got to work.

 # Challange 3

 The trick here is not to get to exited over the fact that you have 2 waves.
