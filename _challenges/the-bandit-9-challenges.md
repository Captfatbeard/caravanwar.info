Week 9 bandit challenges are hard and took me a lot for time to solve, I even had to get some help on challenge 4. But this is not about me, let's take a look at how you can solve them as well and get your rewards!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** 3-star victory

In this challenge you only have towers and I had to use multiple types to get it done. Heres my startup layout.

as soon as you have enough tower points upgrade the last Mage Tower to a Blaze. And add yet a Mage Tower at the very last tower spot to finish of the convoy.

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Windlance towers to the rescue! Pinning down the trains are the only way to win!

Lets take a look at our start setup:

Quickly upgrade the Ranger Tower all the way to Windlance and then use the rest of the tower points on followup Ranger Towers

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** 3-star victory

This challenge took me a while to get as well, but what I found was that you need Bombards in the beginning to separate the Buggys from the Chariots, so taht we can slow down those with the Cannons.

As you get tower points upgrade the Bombard in the middle and follow up with new Bombards at the end.

# Challenge 4

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Let me be honest, I need help from a clan mate to solve this one. I was trying out so many tower combos, but none of them worked. Luckily a clan made told me to use the Windlance.

Now all you need to do is to wait for enough tower points to build a Marksman in the turn.

# Challenge 5

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Not so much to say about this one. Marksmans and a drum is all you need.
