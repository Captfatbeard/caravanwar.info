Time for some more bandit challenges, big shoutout to my clanmate Anantsniper for helping me solve this week.

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

We have had challenges like this one before we need to upgrade a Crossbow into a Windlance at the r()ight moment to pin the Wagon. To expose the Wagon we need to damage some troops with a Mage Tower, so the Artificer starts healing all fall behind.

Start by placing some Blaze Towers again in the first turn and get your spells ready.

I used my mine at the very beginning to make sure I could hit all the vehicles and followed up with the arrows.

Now just wait for tower points and place a Mage Tower and upgrade it to yet another Blaze Tower

# Challenge 5

**Goal:** Loot 800 cargo

This one took me way to long and I tried a lot of ways that other players tried without luck. So Im sad to tell you that I believe this challenge will take some luck, but I still hope my way will help you out!

Start by placing a Crossbow and a Lightning Tower in the first turn. *(this combo was the most consistent for me)*

Now for the Mine spell. I found a way to hit 3 out of 4 vehicles every time. Wait for the Cart to pass the first stone and set your Mine right on top of the horse like this:

As soon as you have the tower points for it build another Mage Tower and cross your fingers that you get the loot.
