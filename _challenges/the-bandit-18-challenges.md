Its Bandit challenge time, let's get them rewards! Big thanks to all my clan mates for sharing replays!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Start by placing two Blaze Towers and a Hospital. Deploy all your troops inside the Hospital range except the Condor, we need him to finish the Wagon off.

Now make sure you hit as much as possible with the Mine and the Fireball. Now drop your Archdevil right on top of everything and follow up with your Lichs next to them. Follow up with an extra Mage Tower.

# Challenge 4

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

The convoy can take two routes in this challenge but the tactic is the same. deploy your Vikings early on the route to separate the Guardians from the Wagon. Make a Mage Tower ready at a turn.

As soon as you're Vikings kills off all the Guardians you can upgrade the Mage Tower to a Blaze to destroy the Wagon.
