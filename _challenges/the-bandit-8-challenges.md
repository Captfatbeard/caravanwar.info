Challenges for week 8 is out, lets take a look on how to solve them!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** 3 star victory

Start by placing a Rocket Tower at the very first spot, and be ready to release your Weavers right then the convoy reaches the second tower spot.

Now you just need to follow up with Ranger towers to kill of the Carts

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** 3 star Victory

Here we need to use Rocket towers to kill all the Griffins and not only use the Berserkers to destroy the Buggy but also holding the Griffins at the same spot so the Rocket towers can kill them of.

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** 3 star victory

This one took me some tries to get, and Im afraid that even through you do the same it will take you tries as well. Please let me know in the comments if you have found a better way to solve this one.

My solution was to use a Marksman and a mage tower in the turn and then as soon as I get enough tower points upgrade the Mage tower to a Blaze tower.

# Challenge 4

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

We have had a challenge very much like this one before, we need to use the Lich's and its Skeletons to destract the Gradians so that you can loot with towers. I used Ranger into Marksman towers.

# Challenge 5

**Goal:**  Loot 1,000 cargo

Timing, timing and some more timing. Yes its all about timing Ranger towers to target the Buggy and let the Griffins fly ahead.
