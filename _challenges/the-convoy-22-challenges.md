Another week another set of Convoy challenges! Let's get those rewards!

A big shout-out to my clanmate MistahDune for sharing his replays with me.

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 350 cargo

You are in the hands of the mighty crit god sadly. To many crits from the Marksman Towers and you lose. Keep on trying, it will work at some point.
