I'm on vacation at the moment so don't have much time to solve challenges, luckily a fellow Red Dragon named sbw shared his replays, so the following is his designs.

All the designs by sbw worked for me in the first try, so you should get these easily

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 200 cargo

The goal of this design is to make sure that the Blaze Tower never hits the Wagon

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 560 cargo

We need the Chariots to take the hits while Machine Guns on the Helicopters finish of the Condors
