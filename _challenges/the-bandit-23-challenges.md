Hey guys. I’m still here, and I’m still doing challenges. I just have a lot on my hands at the moment due to that I’m getting married in 2 weeks. So please be patient.

But enough about me let’s get to the challenges!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

Start by building a Lightning tower in the turn and a Ranger Tower on the last available path like so

As the Golems reaches the Lightning Tower, upgrade it into a Stormspire

Now, wait for the vehicles to reach the Ranger Tower and upgrade it into a Crossbow. The Crossbow should fairly quickly destroy the Cart and you can now upgrade the Crossbow into a Windlance to finish of the Speeder.

# Challenge 3

Build two Marksman Towers right before the turn, like this.

Now as the Convoy reaches the Towers, deploy your Archdevils onto the Steam Vans and Paladins one by one to keep the stun.

Add a couple of Mage Towers as you go along.

# Challenge 5

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

This challenge! I hate it!

This took me way too long, but this tactic was the one that was closest most times.

Build a Cannon at the very start, Hit as many Vans as you can with your Mine.

Deploy your Archdevils one by one on the front-top of the convoy. Not to fast, not to slow, watch the video. *(see what I did there?)*
