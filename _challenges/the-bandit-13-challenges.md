Its week 13! and its week 13 for everyone! Hiker Games changes things up so now were all on the same week, new or old. I love this cause it means it will be easier for me to help you all out!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

This is yet another destract the guardians to expose the cargo. Start by spamming Ranger towers after the first 2 yellow blocks.

Then wait for the convoy to get to the blocks and deploy your Hunters on both sides of the convoy to expose the Airship.

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Lets start the same way, spam ranger towers in the begning of the path and wait for the Airship to get destroyed.

As soon as the Airship is done you can safely deploy all your Berserkers.

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

Another challenge we have seen before. Pin the Wagon with a Windlance at the right moment and get all the loot.

I found it best to do this at the 3rd turn. The wagon is pretty expose after two right turns.

# Challenge 5

**Goal:** 3-star victory

This challenge was hard, and im not sure I got the best tactic on it. But I got it to work multiple times.

Place a healing and get ready to upgrade to Armour Smith. Deploy your troops like so:
