Its thursday and its Convoy challenge time, so lets get to it!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 0 cargo

This challenge seems to be pure luck sadly! I tried so many setups *(big thabks to ever1 sending me there replays)*.

I ended up getting it done with this setup

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 0 cargo

This one went pretty easy, just a lot of tanky units to take all the damage

I had to try a few setups as well on this one, but finally **DianuZ** showed me this setup and I got it to work 3 times, BIG thanks!
