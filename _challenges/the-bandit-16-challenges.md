Its Bandit challenge time, let's get them rewards!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

Place 2 Rocket Towers in the turn so they have more time to shoot kill the first Airship.

As soon as the first Airship is destroyed you can add a 3rd Rocket Tower at the end of the rote.

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** Loot 700 cargo

Yet another timing challenge with the Windlance. Start by placing 2 Crossbow Towers like so.

Now for the timing. Upgrade the last Crossbow to a Winlance the moment the Train is next to the tower. Now the Windlance and the first Crossbow should finish the Train off fast enough for the Windlance to pin down the second Train as well

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** 3-star victory

In this one we need a Windlance to pin down the Train so our Rouge can kill of all the Wagons. Start by making a Crossbow Tower and be ready to upgrade it to a Windlance the second the Train is in range.

Now deploy your Rouge to start destroying the Wagons, one by one. He may need a Mage Tower to help him out then you get the point for one.

# Challenge 4

**Goal:** Loot 1,000 cargo

This one! This one took me way to long, and it seems like it´s another iOS hitbox bug *(has been reported, and may already be fixed then you read this guide)*.

Place down a Rocket Tower in the middle of the 2 turns and a Ranger Tower in the 3rd turn.

Now if your Rocket keeps hitting 2 Helicopters after the first turn, you are going to win. But if it’s only hitting 1 of them, just start over.

If you got it to hit both Helicopters you need to be ready to upgrade your Ranger Tower to a Marksman the moment the first helicopter and Wagon is right in front of it.

Now just hit the Wagon with the mine and deploy your Rouge to get a hit of for the win.

# Challenge 5

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Easy make a Lightning Tower in the first turn and deploy your Rouges on the platform behind it. *(You may need to follow up with a Ranger Tower, but me Rouges got them all by them self)*
