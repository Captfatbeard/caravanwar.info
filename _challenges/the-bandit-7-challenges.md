 # Challange 2

 **Goal:** 1.000 loot

 This one needs some timing. First off we need to separate the guardians from the wagon a little by placing a lighting tower at the beginning of the map.

 Then as soon as the wagon is next to the tower spot in the first turn you need to place a Mage Tower. Lastly you need to time two Mage towers at the last turn to finish the wagon off.

 # Challange 3

 **Goal:** 3 star victory

 This one can take some practice, you need to get most damage out of your spells as fast as possible.

 Start by having 2 Mage towers and 3 Ranger towers places in the turn like this.

 Place your poison spell right then the Buggys reach the bottom bandit placement.

 As soon as the first vehicle leaves the poison place your mine right before the turn.

 Lastly use your arrows in the corner to hit as many vehicles as possible.

 Wait for enough tower points to place your last Ranger tower to finish of the last to Chariots.

 # Challange 4

 **Goal:** loot 1.000

 We got another challenge were luck plays a big part *(at least the way I solved it)*.

 You need a tower to target the Helicopter as soon as possible to separate it from the guardians.

 I used the crossbow to do this because with the double arrows I had twice the possibility for the tower to target the Helicopter. I have seen replays where people have placed the crossbow from the beginning, but I never got that to work.

 So what I did was placing the Ranger tower at the beginning of the first turn and then upgrade it right then the Helicopter starts turning.

 Then the Helicopter is target it will accelerate away from the guardians and you just needs to place Ranger towers along its path

 # Challange 5

 **Goal:** 2 star victory

 Here we have a map with two posible routes. In this guide we expect the convoy to take the first turn.

 Place 2 Marksman towers and a Ranger tower at the first 3 spots. Get your Djiinis ready in the next turn as well.

 Now quickly upgrade your Ranger Tower to a Marksman as soon as the first Cannoneer is taken out.

 Wait for another 150 tower points and place a Mage Tower for the win.
