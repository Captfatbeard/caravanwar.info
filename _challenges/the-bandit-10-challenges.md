Lets look on how to solve week 10 bandit challenges!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** 3-star victory

The Scatter Gun is insane against flying troops, so we need to be spread our Drones and Imps. Start by placing a Crossbow in the first turn and wait for the convoy to arrive.

Then the convoy makes the turn spread your troops on the 3 spots and add Ranger towers as soon as you get points enough.

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** 3-star victory

Start by placing a Bombard at the first tower spot and make another Bombard and Missile Launcher ready at the end. You should now have 90 tower points ready to upgrade the first Bombard, but wait!

As soon as the Air Ship has passed the first Bombard, upgrade it to a Missile Launcher to make it target the Helicopters. As soon as the first Helicopters are destryed upgrade the last Bombard to a Missile Launcher for the win!

# Challenge 5

**Goal:** Loot 1,000

This one takes some timing. Start by placing a Ranger Tower on the first spot in the turn. Then as soon as the Wagon is right next to the tower, upgrade it into a Marksman.
