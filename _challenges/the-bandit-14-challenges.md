Now as you get Tower points add Ranger towers like this. I also had to upgrade the last Ranger to a Marksman to win.

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** 3-star victory

BOOM BABY! Set up 3 Bombards and get ready to add a 4th. Place your Cursed Sorcerers at the corner. We want the Bombards to bring the Guards down to make easier explosions.
