The 3 new convoy challenges are here! Sadly 2 of them seems to be a little luck depending this time. But lets take a look at how I managed to solve them!

# Challenge 1

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 600 cargo

Pretty straight forward. Make the Air Ship tank and let the Helicopters escape

# Challenge 2

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 0 cargo

The goal here is to make the Spartans take most of the Pinning shots from the Windlance tower. This challenge is a little luck based at the end. The last Pinning Shot has to target a champion!

# Challenge 3

**Goal:** Get robbed fewer than 300 cargo

This one felt luck based as well, I have seen a lot of replays and all comes very close to the 300 cargo, I even saw some one win with 304 cargo stolen. :-/

Based on other design and replays I think I have one of the best designs to success here.

Let me know in the comments if my designs helped you or if you came up with even better ones. I would love to see it!
