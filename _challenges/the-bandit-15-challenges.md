This has to be the easiest set of bandit challenge so far. But still I want to give a big shoutout to my man Mr.Manh for sharing his replays for me to use right then I woke up! Now lets get you your rewards!

# Challenge 1

Goal: 3-star victory

Hiker Games want to remind us that theres a tower called Stormspire, and I must say that im tempted to try it out in a real ambush after seeing it in action in this challenge.

Start by placing a Stormspire and all your troops *(except the Witch Doctor)* in the first turn. as soon as your Infernal dies deploy your Witch Doctor to get a new Infernal! Follow the airship with a couple of Mage Towers

# Challenge 3

Goal: Loot 1,000 cargo

You know this already, its another timing Windlance challenge. But this time we can use a Stormspire at the start to split the trains from there Guardians.

Start with this setup and be ready for the first train to take the second turn and get in front of the Crossbow that you now upgrade to a Windlance. Now just sit back and relax the next train will take the first ones place in time.

# Challenge 4

Goal: 3-star victory

Im quite sure this can be solved in a million ways, but what I did here was having a Cannon in the first turn, and as soon as the reach it just using all my spells on the same spot!

Now just upgrade the Cannon to a Hydra and follow the convoy with Ranger Towers as you get the points for them.
