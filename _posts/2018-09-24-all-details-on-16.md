New updates are always exciting and 1.6 does not seem to be any different in that regard. This article aims to cover all the news, also the “hidden” ones.

## New difficulty modes in Campaign

We can finally finish the “Twinkle Twinkle” Achievement!! With that said, we also get a lot of gold, cargo, and free chests:

 - 3x2 Iron Chests
 - 4x2 Silver Chests
 - 7x2 Golden Chests

## Convoy formation preset

You can now save up to 3 convoy layouts. This will make it less of a hassle to test out new layout designs, then with a click, you can load back to an old one if the new one fails you.

## Automatically save previous bandit formation.

In the Tavern, the Bandits will be reloaded automatically after all are done healing.

## See the whole convoy

For a long time, you haven't been able to see the first wave of a convoy *(lvl 15+)* on the ambush screen. But that seems to have been fixed now.

## Tower upgrade helper

Now as you build towers you get shown its upgrades without needing to tap it again. This makes it a lot faster to build a fully upgraded tower like the Hydra.

## New paused screen

Before 1.6 if you left the game during an ambush to reply on a message or something and came back, the game would just start. Now you get this new pause screen.
