New info leaked about Stormspire, the new description is as following:

> Freezes enemies for [x duration]sec. Frozen targets take no damage and cause their foes to look for other targets. Deals damage equal to [value]% target's max health, if the tower's lever is lower than the target's only deals 50% damage.

So basically you need to be the same level or higher then the opponent otherwise it does 50% less damage.

The damage is based on the units max hp (max hp dmg is 11%).

As for an example Golem got 50.000 Health. SS does 11% max hp dmg. Which means you will do around 5.500 dmg.

I've got my clear opinion about this, what do you guys think?

For me, personally it's a big nerf and it will ruin the standard of the game and everything will be harder by collecting cargo.
