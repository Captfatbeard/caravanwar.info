So, attacking a player, you can get an additional reward - a Christmas card.

These cards you can give a clan member or enemy.

These cards you can give a clan member or enemy.

Received postcards you can open and get resources + spells. The number of resources depends on the rank!

To fill the scale, all 50 clan players or enemies need to send postcards. One player = one postcard. And do not forget that you can still look at the cards sent to you and at the same time thank them - by sending a reply card.

The first Christmas chest was opened by the DryHeave player.

As you can see - the chest contains at least 1 Legendary card, well, and other types of cards!

P.S. can no longer open the chest. If you send postcards more than 50 times, the scale will stop at 50/50, and the sent postcards will accumulate!

Dude, thank you for the screenshots and info!
