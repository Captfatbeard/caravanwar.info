Last week Hiker Games announced the coming of the 1.4 update, and with that the news that 5 more lvls are coming.

We all thought that the update already would have dropped and multiple people have heard from support that it was coming this week.

But now we got a in game notice, and with that even more details about this update.

## Experimental clan war mode "2 versus 2"

Over the last month Hiker Games have made minor changes to the clan wars like upping the trade time from 4 to 8 and making it possible to send out both convoys at the same time.

But adding a whole new mode is gonna be exiting, and Im for one is looking forward to see how the matching is gonna work.

Another exciting thing about this new mode, is that this will open up the possibility that Hiker Games are gonna add even more modes and switch between them from time to time.

## In-game encyclopedia with video instructions

I know that a lot of people don't care about this. "We know the game already". But its cool to see Hiker Games making it easier for new people to jump into the game, especially then the game is getting more and more details.

## Level 16-20 unlocked with new visual

This one is huge! 5 levels! 5! That is a huge jump when we are talking top HQ levels.

I'm very happy to see new visual effects!
