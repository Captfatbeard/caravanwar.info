How Clan War works by Hiker Games. originally posted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/caravan-war/all-about-clan-war/1014808475373421/).

## 1. How to participate:

You need to join a Clan before register to participate in Clan Wars. Any member of the Clan can press the “Register” button as the registration is not applied automatically.

## 2. Clan War Matchmaking

This is the first time we explain to the users the rule of Matchmaking in Caravan War. We would like to emphasize that Clan War Matchmaking does not depend on the number of Trophies, the level of the Clan or the number of members in the Clan.

The system is based on the convoy and bandit formation of each member in the Clan to calculate “the power”. After getting the “Total power” of the Clan, the system based on “win-lose streak” to add bonus points for the “Total power”.

Every clan participating in Clan War are ranked from low to high based on “Total power”. The system will choose randomly 1-4 adjacent Clans in this ranking for Matchmaking.

## 3. Number of cargos

The total number of cargoes for 1 Clan = The number of cargoes that each member can carry multiply with the number of members;

In a match, the same number of cargoes for both will be based on the Clan with a lower total number of cargoes.

## 4. Win or lose

After the Clan War, the Clan with a higher number of cargoes delivered will be the winner;

In the Victory/Defeat chest, the amount of gold received per member is proportional to the number of cargoes this person protected;

If both clans have the same number of cargoes delivered, the Clan with more Trophies win be the winner.
