The 1.5 update is finally here, and after a rough start with a ambush/config bug we are ready to enjoy the new features. So lets take a look on what we got this time.

## Boos fight!

This is the new weekly game mode, and you can read more about it in this article: [Boss Fight is coming](https://caravanwar.info/article/boss-fight-is-comming).

I was told it would be held every Monday, but ingame it looks to be on Wednesdays instead and first one will be next week.

## New Units

We knew that we would get 4 new legendaries and a new epic, but we only knew about the Warlock. So lets take a closer look on the new units.

**Archdevil:**

A new legendary bandit with the ability called Slam that stuns enemies surrounding him.

Archdevil costs 10 Bandit points

**Viking**

A new epic bandit with an Enrage ability.

Viking costs 8 bandit points.

**Speeder**

New Legendary vehicle with an ability to speed up itself and nearby allies *(both vehicles and guardians)*.

Speeder takes up 4x2 in convoy space.

**Warlock**

The new legendary guardian we were teased with a couple of weeks ago. He has an ability called unleash witch stuns surrounding enemies then he drops below half HP.

Warlock takes the same space as a Goem (3x2.)

## Battle Pass

We still don't know much about this, and the update didn't make it any more clear yet. What I know is that its an endless mission system en "big" rewards. The battle pass is an event, not a regular activity. Each event will have different content.

## Various UI and performance improvements.

So far the player WidowMakerTM found that the Sacrifice button in Recycle Chest has been moved under the troops.

Fixed the bug where the game would crash on phone calls

Fast sacrifice is now a thing. You can hold down on a card to add it faster!

## 8 Bandit spots

This one is nice! I really love it. You can now have 2 more types of troops in your ambush setup!
