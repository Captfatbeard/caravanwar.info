An Altar is a sacred place, as well as a building. Yes, yes, a building where you improve the abilities of units **(bandits, guards, vehicles, and add-ons)** by sacrificing cards of the same type. For example, you have 5 Genies lying around, and you go sacrificing one of them at the Altar, thereby increasing his abilities.

To improve a Legendary unit for 1 star, we need another card of this unit. For 2 stars - 2 cards and so on.

For Epic - 2 cards of the same unit, for 2 stars you need 3 cards and so on.

For Rare cards, 30 cards are needed, then 40, 50, 100, 120 and so on. And for add-ons - 40 and more.

*P.S To improve the unit must be one card more, otherwise, it will not be possible to improve.*

Each sacrifice will give you an amount of Tower Cores. The most expensive is Legendary Cards. They give starting from 100 Cores. Epic from 20. Rare from 4, and Usual from 2.

You ask, what to do with these Cores? And I will answer: to accumulate the required number of Cores, for example, 180 for the tower of shooters. In the Towers tab, select the appropriate tower and upgrade to the first level.

Important! All towers of the type of towers are being improved - the Tower of the Shooters, the Tower of Magic, the Bombard, the Hospital.

Next, we are saving 320 for the second level, 360 for the third, and so on.

You can upgrade units and towers, in total, up to 15 stars, but in the unit itself, up to 5 stars will be displayed.

1-5 is gray

6-10 is gold

11-15 is red

Basically, that's all. I hope it was useful ;-)
