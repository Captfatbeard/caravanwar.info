A couple of days ago I came across an art portfolio of a user called "[do thinh](https://www.artstation.com/hludarksoul)", who apparently is doing some 3D artwork at Hiker Games.

On his page, he has some of the buildings we know from the game. Armory Tower, Bandit Camp, and Drummer Tower, but he also has a model of a tower that ain't in the game yet.

it's called the "Bounty Tower", so I'm assuming that this is a new ambush tower, which would indicate that we're gonna see at least 4 more towers in the game at some point.

If its a new tower type or an upgrade from one of the existing once I don't know.Â 

Another idea is that this is a new building to give us a new way to upgrade our Bandits?

Let me know in the comments what do you think this tower is?

Here the images from the [portfolia](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/x0gZW).
