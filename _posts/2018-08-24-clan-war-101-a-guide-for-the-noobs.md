So you’ve joined a clan. The weekend rolls around and now it’s war time. Now what?

First thing is listen to the more experienced members in your clan. They have done this time and time again. If you have questions, just ask.

Now let’s go through how a few things are going to happen. At 03:00 UTC Friday *(you will have to check this and compare it to your own time zone)*, clan war matchmaking begins. You must have joined the clan before matchmaking begins to participate in the current war. Then at 02:00 UTC Saturday, matchmaking ends. At 03:00 UTC Saturday war starts.

Ok, war has begun. Every member in the clan has 2 convoys they can send, and 2 attacks to try and destroy as much cargo as possible. As you get to higher leagues, your convoy will carry more cargo in war. You will have 16 hours from the start of war to send both convoys. You can make attacks at any time during the 24 hours. Some clans will give their members strategies to follow on when to send and who to attack. Other, more casual clans, just let you run free.

There are a few general rules that most clans will follow. You usually don’t want to hit a convoy that has already been hit *(even if the convoy still has cargo left)*. You don’t want to attack a convoy way above or below yourself. *(For example if you have lvl 7 bandits you wouldn’t want to attack a convoy with lvl 6 or lvl 9 guardians.)* The only time you might want to attack a convoy multiple times, or attack one that is far above or below you, is in the last 8 hours of war. Then the opposing clan can’t send any more convoys. In this case you will want to attack whatever you think will take the most cargo. You also want to make sure you use your trade spells, usually saving your best ones for war.

Whichever clan ends the war with the most cargo wins the war.

If your clan is matched with a clan with fewer members, then your clan will have a cargo limit. This helps to balance wars with uneven members.

After war is finished, the winning clan’s members gets a victory chest *(34% chance to get a legendary plus 100 gems)*, and the losing clan’s members gets a defeat chest *(17% chance to get a legendary plus 50 gems)*. All members also get a gold bonus *(amount depending on how much cargo you defend as well as how much you destroy in ambush)*. War rewards are only available for 48 hours after war is finished.

If you have more questions that your clan mates can’t answer, please leave your questions in the comments below.
