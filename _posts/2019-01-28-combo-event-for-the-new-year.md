# Happy lunar new year

Today Hiker games released Happy Lunar New Year event.

Its pretty much the same as Christmas event we had during the holidays.

You ambush and loot cards, you send them to opponents or your clan members.

# How it works?

You need to send at least 50 cards to receive a chest. Clan members or opponents can send you 100 cards.

Cards that you receive contains gold, cargo, and common loot.

# Rewards?

Hopefully, you will get a legendary chest as last time which contains at least a legendary card and a few epics.

# Battle pass

Another thing that we are familiar with is the Battle pass. For those people that have this event for the first time, it is an event where you do missions.

Some missions are during the whole time that the event is and there are 3 missions that you got to do as a daily mission.

You can use gems to speed up your experience to gain levels faster, I wouldn't if it's not necessary.

Last time you had plenty of time doing the missions and gain what you need to hit those nice rewards at the end.

# Rewards?

The rewards are similar to what they gave you last time. The rewards that are new is that you get one more legendary at the premium version and you miss out on some gems.

The free battle pass is more worthy than last time, now you get loot on every level you are on. You get more gems and another epic chest as well.
