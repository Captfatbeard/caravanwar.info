The first update of the year will be 2.2 and it will contain additional:

- Max HQ will be 25.
- 2 new ranks
- Stormspire Fix
- New equipped system for units

There we go as I wrote at the start this is the first update of the year and it will be fun for those that are almost full lvl 20.

I hope they will get satisfied with the new ranks, leagues, units higher HQ and most of all the new Stormspire fix.

Developers even bring a new way to take your units to higher ground as being able to switch armor pieces such as shoes, helmet, and body armor.

Every player has their own opinion about if it's good with new HQ levels or if it just makes the game harder for the ones that are newcomers.

Hopefully, the new ranks and everything can make the players stay and continue to provide fun for everyone.
