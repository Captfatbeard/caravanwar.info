So yesterday Hiker Games [announced](https://www.facebook.com/caravanwar/photos/a.752999868220951/985264158327853/?type=3) a new Game Mode called Boss Fight to arrive with the 1.5 update.

> ⛔⛔ Upcoming in the 1.5 update

> SNEAK PEEK #2: New Game Mode: Boss Fight

> It's the first time your convoy has a chance to battle side-by-side with a powerful enemy. How will you lead your caravan to the victory?

I have been trying to get some more info on this new Game Mode and heres what I know so far.

This Game Mode will be a weekly challenge like the bandit and convoy challenges and Boss Fight will be the Monday Challenge.

Your going to face a mighty Boss with your own guardians! yes your own guardians. Were not going to get specific guardians for this challenge like in the other ones.

There will be deferent Bosses and each boss will have unique fighting styles and you have to figure out the best way to take them down.

This challenge sounds really fun, but I'm curious in how its going to be balanced then your using your own guardians. Not everyone has 20+ legendaries to fight with.

What do you think? What type of bosses will we see? and are your guardians ready for a fight!?
