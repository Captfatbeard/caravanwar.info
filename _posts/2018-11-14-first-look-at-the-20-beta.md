"A Fortnite and Clash of Clans ripoff", no I'm joking, well it is a ripoff but it's a good one!

I love the Clan War League, but we need to see how the matchmaking will work around it.

Fighting 4-5 clans in a small tournament give you insight on who's performing well. It will also increase the commitment needed for the war and therefore increase the competition. From a war and skill point of view, not just on the cups.

Yet, the p2w aspects will still be present and p2w clans will probably climb the ladder faster than others.

The co-op missions and the battle pass will definitely keep us busy, making the upgrade grind faster and funnier

Enough talk, here's some screenshots from the beta:
