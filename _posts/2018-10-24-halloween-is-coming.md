Hiker Games just announced that Halloween is coming to the game, and I for one is really looking forward to it.

The event will be active for almost 3 days starting October 29 3 AM *(UTC)* and ending November 1, 12 PM *(UTC)*

During the event The number of wounded units after every battle is reduced by half, so you should be able to get a lot more ambushes in.

But let us talk about the most exciting part of this event! With each ambush win, there's a 5% chance to receive a Legendary Card, and a 20% chance to receive an Epic Card!

Sadly there's a cap on this *(1 Legendary and 3 Epics in the period of the event)*. With a 5% chance of a Legendary, I personally find the cap of only 1 a bit cheap, but a "free" Legendary is a Legendary.

All in all, I'm really looking forward to this event! What about you!?
