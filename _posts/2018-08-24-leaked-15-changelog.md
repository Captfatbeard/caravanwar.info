Just got this changelog for 1.5 and I thought you guys would like to see it as well.

**Update 1.5**

 * Boss fight! New boss challenge every week!
 * 5 brand new units: 4 Legendary and 1 Epic Bandits, Guard, Vehicle, and Add-on.
 * New Battle Pass system with endless missions and enormous rewards.
 * Various UI and performance improvements

Yeah you read correct, were getting 4 new legendaries! We know about the [Warlock](/article/warlock-is-here), but not the other 3.

Battle Pass is stating to be a thing in all games and now its coming to Caravan War. what these endless battles are, we still have to wait and see.

Are you excited for this update? I know I am!
