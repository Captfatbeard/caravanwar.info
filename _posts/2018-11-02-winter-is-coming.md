I just got this image sent from Hiker Games, showing the game in a winter theme, which hints that we will get some kind of winter/Christmas event.

Furthermore, I was told that this new theme will come in 2.0! yeah, 2.0 is coming!

This can mean a lot of things to come, but one thing is sure. We will finally get the Battle Pass!

What do you guys think we will get in 2.0? Or what do you hope for?
