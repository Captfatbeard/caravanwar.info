Hiker Games just revealed a new unit concept on facebook. This is what we know so far about it.

His name is **Warlock** and he is a new Legendary Guardian for your convoy. His a powerful sorcerer with the ability to control the natural elements around him.

Once he gets attacked, he can activate his ultimate spell to make the enemy paralyzed.

Personally I think this unit looks badass, and im very excited to see him in action.

What about you? What do you think about this new Guardian?
