So Hiker Games just released 2.1 in Beta and once again Dualtuin will take us throw the changes to come!

Tons of new achievements, which take into account your total statistics, meaning that as soon as you log in you will get a lot of gold, cargo, and gems.

New Christmas theme with decorations on trees and a Christmas tree in front of your HQ.

New HUD *(Head-up display)*, some icons changed or got organized differently to allow more icons to fit in the screen.

Christmas feature looks like fully f2p *(not verified yet)* and I really appreciate it.

For every attack, you win you gain 1 Christmas card *(not verified yet)*. You can then send the Christmas card to clan mates or enemies you attacked.

For every Christmas card you send you gain 1 Lucky point and at 50 Lucky points, you are able to open the "Christmas Gift". What will it contain? I wonder if its content depends if the player has been naughty or good haha. We'll see, I guess/hope it will be an epic/legendary chest.

Finally, it looks like you can open the Christmas Cards you receive, but I haven't tried this yet.

Shop now shows the chances of receiving cards of different rarity.
