Let me begin to say that this game is just wonderful in every way possible for freemium genre games. It has its ups and downs of course.

My concern is the Guild Championship and its rewards. The amount of gems given is no incentive or motivation to move up in ranks and that's shown by the number of high-level players hiding in low-level battle points.

Also, only rewarding top 20 clan members should be changed to the whole team because it's a team effort, and only rewarding some members creates envy as well pressure on players making them to just give up.

Moving forward, I suggest that the top 100 clans should be rewarded with gems to make a more fair and balanced environment for everyone. This will push high-level players from hiding in small clans and create a more competitive atmosphere pushing players to play more for rewards.

If you keep aiming only for top 10 then the game won't grow because looking at top 10 clans, I'd rather quit than waste time trying to climb up to their level for a small incentive.
