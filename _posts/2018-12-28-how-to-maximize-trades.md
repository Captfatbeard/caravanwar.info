This guide will talk about how to maximize the amount of gold each trade brings in.

**How can I maximize my trade income?** By reducing the amount of cargo *(and thus gold)* stolen during transport!

Before trying to understand the solution to maximizing gold through trades, let's first go through some quick game mechanics:

Trade gold is generated by trading cargo. The longer the trade, the more gold is generated at the conclusion of the trade. If your convoy is ambushed during the trade, there is a chance you will lose some, or at most half of the cargo before the trade is completed. This will greatly reduce the amount of gold awarded from a successful trade. In some cases, if you lose enough cargo, you can actually get less than 1:1 cargo/gold value on the trade *(nightmare scenario!)*

So obviously reducing cargo loss is the utmost priority when trying to generate maximum gold value through trades. And there are 3 very good ways to reduce cargo loss:

 1. Increase your Guardian Level *(duh, but certainly this is the most important, it just takes the longest and costs the most)*
 2. Use trade spells to make your guardians harder to kill/tougher
 3. And of course, the final option at your disposal, which is the purpose of this article, make your best trade harder to find!

Wait, what? I can hide trades? Well yes! Sort of....*(ha)*. Let me explain:

To better understand how to hide trades, let's first understand how ambushes work. When a player elects to look for an ambush, the system will present him with an ambush option *(another playerâ€™s caravan or trade)*. The system uses several criteria to determine which caravan/trade to present to a player for an ambush:

> League of the ambushing player *(Only players of a similar league are considered. An ambushing player is given the option to attack a caravan/trade of the same league, or plus or minus 1 league from their current league)*

> Time remaining on the current caravan/trade *(trades that have less than 4 minutes remaining are not presented)*

> Amount of cargo remaining on the current caravan/trade. If a caravan/trade has already been ambushed, it CAN be ambushed again, but only if a certain % of the cargo is still remaining *(the first ambush was not very successful, and so there is a sizable amount of cargo remaining to ambush)*

> And finally, if a player has any caravans/trades in progress

> And that's it. If a caravan/trade does not meet ALL of the criteria above, it cannot be presented to an ambushing player

> Now that we understand how the ambush system *(roughly)* works, now we can take steps to minimize the number of times our greatest trade(s) are attacked. Note that I am focusing on the "greatest trade", which also includes the "thousand-mile trade" because those are the 2 biggest, and therefore 2 most lucrative, trades that we have. This guide does not claim to help all trades but certainly can help to protect the "greatest trades". So how do we protect the 2 best trades? Simple, By launching all trades at once, and keeping them all running until the greatest trade is complete!

Wait, What??? You're saying the best way to get the best odds of a successful "greatest trade" is to launch ALL trades at the same time? The answer to that is YES! And here's why...

We know the rough parameters the system uses to present a caravan to ambush to a player looking to attack our trades. We know that, assuming a bunch of people fit the requirements of an ambush above, after that it's just a lottery system. If 20 people fit the ambush criteria, we have a 1/20 chance of our trade being presented for an ambush. If only 1 person fits the requirements of an ambush as outlined above, then we have a 100% *(1/1)* chance of being presented for an ambush. And as a result, by launching ALL of our trades, we can reduce the odds of our "lottery ball" being picked out of a hat as the supposed "winner" of the ambush lottery.

Let me explain. Let's use the lottery example again, and let's also assume I'm the only trade that fits the requirements for an ambush. When a player selects to ambush, the system will pick my name, and if my only trade is the greatest trade *(more on this in a moment)*, then there will be a 100% chance that the ambushing player will get an option to attack my greatest trade. But we can change these odds a little bit! Even if I'm still the only player that fits the ambush requirements, I can reduce the odds that the lottery picks my greatest trade. How? By adding more lottery balls *(more trades)* to the lottery! If we launch all trades at the same time, that's 4 more trades added to the lottery. Our odds of the greatest trade getting selected goes from 100% *(when we only had 1 trade)*, to now 25% *(1/4)* because we have all 4 trades going at the same time. And when you also include the transport station trade which always runs in the background, it's actually 20% *(1/5)*. And just like that, we've reduced the chance that our greatest trade will be presented as an ambush option for another player looking for a convoy to attack.

Now keep in mind, the ten-mile trade only last 30 minutes. The greatest trade lasts 4 hours. If the ten-mile trade is completed, and another ten-mile trade is not immediately started, the odds of the greatest trade getting selected for the lottery goes up again *(this is bad!)*. That's why is imperative to keep all 4 trades running for as much of the greatest trade length *(4 hours)* as possible! That's 8 ten mile trades, 3 hundred mile trades *(yes you will run out, that's only 3 hours total)*, and 2 thousand mile trades. 13 trades total, plus your 1 greatest trade. Keeping them all running for the entire duration, minimizes the chance that your greatest trade will get selected for the lottery.

And you know what else minimizes your chance of getting selected for the lottery? Launching your trades when everyone else in your league is launching their trades! I said above that the biggest danger is when you're the only caravan that's running, so find out when the other caravans are running from other players, and run with them. Because running your trades while other players are running their trades will lessen the odds of your greatest trade being ambushed because there are more trades overall to select from. If 1 person is in the lottery with 5 trades, there is a 20% chance your greatest trade will get selected, but if 100 people are in the lottery, and they all have at least 1 trade, there is only a 0.995% chance *(1/105)* your greatest trade will get selected *(all else equal)*. Generally in my league the best time to hide my trades are at server reset *(00:00 GMT)* because many others are anxious to get their trades going to get gold flowing, and 20:00 GMT because the late procrastinators waited until the end of the day and are pushing to get their trades launched before server reset.

But wait, my trades get attacked WAY more than 1% of the time!! Well, there are a few reasons for that:

> Who knows the actual number of people launching trades, it might be less than 100, it might be less than 50. That obviously makes the lottery odds change

> Who knows the actual number of people launching ambushes. Even if you have 100 people launching trades, if another 100 people are launching ambushes, the lottery odds change drastically as well

> And of course, people who are ambushing have the option to try for a better caravan to attack! So even though the system might show the ambusher a ten-mile trade, the ambusher has the option to search for another, larger caravan instead

> And of course all of that is true, but it doesn't change the math. If there are a lot of people online or a little, launching ALL trades, and keeping ALL trades running, minimizes the chance of my greatest trade being served up by the system for an ambush. Similarly, If there are a lot of ambushers, keeping ALL trades running for the ENTIRE 4-hour duration gives better odds of not being selected than another player who is only running the greatest trade. And finally, even if the ambusher is hitting search again for only the juiciest caravan, using the ALL trade method lessens the chance that he will find my greatest trade before he finds someone else's greatest trade.

Give it a try, do it for a few days, without deviation. Remember to do ALL trades, running for the ENTIRE 4 hours, and see if you don't lose your greatest trade less often than you were before. Good Luck!
