# Abilities:

**Boost:** Boosts the movement speed of itself and every nearby allies by 30%.

# Description

Before going into details, we will show you its power. Arrange Speeder at the end of wave 3 - wave 5, middle lane and watch.

Infantry and flying units’ movement speed increases when Speeder is near. Especially, Speeder groups convoy into a block with insane damage and armor, which is why we call it “ The Mobile Fortress” :smiley: This fortress will be a challenge for Canon, Marksman or Blaze. Hydra? Probably crying in the corner after caught a glimpse of it from the distance.

Bonus for ones who like speed: if you have 1 wave speed such as Buggy, Griffin Rider or Chariot, try to arrange Speeder ahead of that wave. We are sure that this item will give you a delightful surprise.
