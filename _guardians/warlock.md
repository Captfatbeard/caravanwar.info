## Abilities:

**Unleash**

When his own HP fall below 50%, the Warlock unleashes his energy to stun all the surrounding enemies for 1s. Activate once ther battle.

## Description:

This unit’s stats are not that powerful however with the right method, you can implement many unique strategies using Warlock.

In order to make use of this unit, try to put it in the middle or at the end of a wave. During battle, Warlock is capable of dashing towards units standing before it and fighting with them. As usual, the front line will use the ability to engage and receive damage from the enemy. It’s time for Warlock to shine: STUNT! Players usually drop their Bandits in a group which means it is easier for Warlock to stunt multiple targets. With 1s-stunt-duration, we recommend scatter Warlock around the convoy to maximize its stunt.

Another Warlock’s advantage is its ability to float above. It is untouchable by infantry units and considered a tanker for other flying units such as Air Balloon and Helicopter.

Its weakness is similar to Arch Devil, sacrifice for its comrades Y.Y. An effective formation should have only enough Warlock and not too many. With this AoE stun, you can take full control of the battle. Warlock will scare the life out of the enemies since first 1 or 2 waves of your convoy were already unstoppable.
